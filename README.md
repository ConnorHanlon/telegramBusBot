TODO:
- Re-adjust to command pattern
- Pull Webhook out of HandleRequest
- Maybe create class dedicated to storing and retrieving website urls
- create a formatter in the URLCreator class for each of the bus commands, and
  change the implementation of format such that the individual commands call
  the required formatter from URLCreator.

- Create telegram command classes
